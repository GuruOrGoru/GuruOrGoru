## 📜 The Beginning  
I come from a small city in Nepal called Biratnagar,  
where life is not easy and dreams often feel far away.  
Growing up, technology was something I saw from a distance—  
like a story someone told but I never really believed in.  
Then one day, my father handed me a laptop,  
something he had saved for over three years to buy for me.  

It wasn’t just a machine, it was hope wrapped in plastic.  
At first, I used it to play games and watch videos,  
but soon the boredom crept in, and I found myself looking for more.  
That’s when I tried my first program, and typed:  
`printf("Hello World");`  
In that moment, something inside me woke up—  
a small spark that told me this was just the start.

## 💻 My Journey With Code  
I started with **C**—the language that is hard but honest.  
It made me think deeply, work carefully, and never give up.  
After that, I tried many languages—Python for fast results,  
Java for building big things, and JavaScript for the wild side of the web.  
But now, my heart stays with **Golang**—simple, strong, and clear.  

I am not a master programmer.  
I am a student of mistakes, fixes, and late-night struggles.  
My lessons come from bugs that won’t go away,  
and from code that refuses to run until I understand it better.

## 🚀 What I Have Made  
I have worked on nearly **100 projects**—some small, some bigger.  
Many I lost along the way, like pages torn from a book.  
But every lost project taught me something new,  
and some even helped me win hackathons or make new friends.  

Not every project was perfect,  
some were just me copying code and hoping it worked,  
but all of them were steps forward.

## 🌱 What I Am Doing Now  
Right now, I am building a portfolio—not just to show off,  
but to prove to myself that I can create real things,  
things that help people and carry meaning.  

Hackathons are my battlefields,  
where strangers become teammates,  
and we build dreams in a short time,  
sometimes winning, sometimes learning,  
but always growing.

## 🎯 What I Believe  
> *"Learning is endless—like the tabs open in a coder’s browser."*

I try to write code that my future self will thank me for,  
and that makes my past self proud.  
I code with joy, ship with hope,  
and debug with patience—because sometimes, that’s all you have.

### A Little Joke  
I once thought `404` was a lucky number.  
Turns out, it just means “Not Found”—kind of like my sleep schedule.
