## 📜 The Prologue
In the far-east corner of Nepal, under the smoky skies of Biratnagar,  
a boy was born not with a silver spoon, but with a mountain of responsibilities.  
Technology was a distant rumor in my childhood—like dragons or a stable WiFi connection.  
Until one fateful day... **I got my first laptop.**

It wasn’t just a laptop; it was a monument of patience and love—  
purchased after three long years of my father’s savings.  
At first, I used it like any ordinary mortal: browsing, gaming,  
and occasionally staring at the screen wondering if the laptop stared back.  
But boredom arrived early... until programming happened.  

And oh dear Universe—when I wrote my first `printf("Hello World");`  
I swear I could hear the cosmic compiler whisper,  
*"Welcome, child, your recursion begins here."*

## 💻 My Journey Through The Syntax Jungle
I began with **C**, the gateway drug of programming.  
It was harsh, unforgiving, and yet… beautifully raw.  
Soon I found myself hopping languages like a caffeinated monkey:  
Python for quick tricks, Java for heavy lifting,  
JavaScript for… chaos.  
And now—my heart belongs to **Golang**.  

I am not a professional developer.  
I am a **lifelong student** in the infinite university of bugs, commits, and coffee spills.  
My tuition fee? Debugging errors at 3 AM.

## 🚀 My Creations
I’ve built around **100 projects** —  
many lost to the cruel abyss of OS changes and forgotten accounts.  
Like a poet who burned their own manuscripts,  
I let some projects vanish so better ones could be born.  

Some survived. Some even won **hackathons**.  
(And some… were just Stack Overflow code wearing sunglasses.)

## 🌱 The Present Quest
Right now, I’m on a sacred mission:  
To build a **portfolio worthy of my first job**.  
Not just a job to pay bills—  
but a job to build bridges between my code and the beating hearts who use it.  

Hackathons are my playground,  
where I meet strangers, turn them into teammates,  
and together, we forge something from nothing in 48 sleepless hours.  
Sometimes we win. Sometimes we lose.  
But every time—we create.

## 🎯 My Philosophy
> *"Learning never ends,  
> just like the number of tabs in a developer’s browser."* — Me

I believe in writing code that’s clean enough to make my future self thank me,  
and complex enough to make my past self cry.  
I code with humor, ship with passion,  
and debug with a patience that can outlast a Nepali power cut.

### Fun Fact:
I once thought `404` was a lucky number.  
Turns out, it just meant “Not Found” — like my sleep schedule.
