    <h2>📜 The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      I come from a small city in Nepal called <strong>Biratnagar</strong>, where life is not easy and dreams often feel far away.<br />
      Growing up, technology was something I saw from a distance — like a story someone told but I never really believed in.<br />
      Then one day, my father handed me a laptop, something he had saved for over three years to buy for me.<br /><br />
      It wasn’t just a machine, it was hope wrapped in plastic.<br />
      At first, I used it to play games and watch videos, but soon the boredom crept in, and I found myself looking for more.<br />
      That’s when I tried my first program, and typed: <code>printf("Hello World");</code><br />
      In that moment, something inside me woke up — a small spark that told me this was just the start.
    </p>

    <h2>💻 My Journey With Code</h2>
    <p>
      I started with <strong>C</strong> — the language that is hard but honest.<br />
      It made me think deeply, work carefully, and never give up.<br />
      After that, I tried many languages — Python for fast results, Java for building big things, and JavaScript for the wild side of the web.<br />
      But now, my heart stays with <strong>Golang</strong> — simple, strong, and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not a master programmer.<br />
      I am a student of mistakes, fixes, and late-night struggles.<br />
      My lessons come from bugs that won’t go away, and from code that refuses to run until I understand it better.
    </p>

    <h2>🚀 What I Have Made</h2>
    <p>
      I have worked on nearly <strong>100 projects</strong> — some small, some bigger.<br />
      Many I lost along the way, like pages torn from a book.<br />
      But every lost project taught me something new, and some even helped me win hackathons or make new friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not every project was perfect, some were just me copying code and hoping it worked, but all of them were steps forward.
    </p>

    <h2>🌱 What I Am Doing Now</h2>
    <p>
      Right now, I am building a portfolio — not just to show off, but to prove to myself that I can create real things,<br />
      things that help people and carry meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackathons are my battlefields, where strangers become teammates,<br />
      and we build dreams in a short time, sometimes winning, sometimes learning, but always growing.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>🎯 What I Believe</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Learning is endless — like the tabs open in a coder’s browser.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I try to write code that my future self will thank me for,<br />
      and that makes my past self proud.<br />
      I code with joy, ship with hope,<br />
      and debug with patience — because sometimes, that’s all you have.

    <h2>😂 A Little Joke</h2>
    <p>
      I once thought <code>404</code> was a lucky number.<br />
      Turns out, it just means “Not Found” — kind of like my sleep schedule.
